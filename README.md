# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Solved

Supervised machine learning repository consist of data analysis and data modelling work on different dataset. Every directory contains the different method that was used for building a model. Infact it can be said that the different parts of Supervised Learning approach is covered in this repository.

Multiple works will be uploaded after the preparation of the notebook.

List of Supervised Learning Activity:
