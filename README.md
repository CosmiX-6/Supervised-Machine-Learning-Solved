# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Solved

Supervised machine learning repository consist of data analysis and data modelling work on different dataset. Every directory contains the different method that was used for building a model. Infact it can be said that the different parts of Supervised Learning approach is covered in this repository.

Multiple works will be uploaded after the preparation of the notebook.

List of Supervised Learning Activity:

1. [Vehicle Performance Prediction](https://github.com/CosmiX-6/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Solved/tree/master/VehiclePerformancePrediction "Goto Vehicle Performance")
	+ contains EDA + Model Development + Stochastic Gradient Descent
2. [Digit Handwriting Classification](https://github.com/CosmiX-6/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Solved/tree/master/Digit%20Handwriting%20Classification "Goto Digit Classification")
    + contains Model Development + Neural Network + Tensorflow
3. [Recipe Analysis](https://github.com/CosmiX-6/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Solved/tree/master/Recipes%20Analysis "Goto Recipe Analysis")
    + contains simple Data Analysis
4. [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/CosmiX-6/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Solved/tree/master/Sentiment%20Analysis "Goto Sentiment Analysis")
    + contains simple NLP and Data Modelling

More work will be added soon and the information will be updated on addition of each new work.
