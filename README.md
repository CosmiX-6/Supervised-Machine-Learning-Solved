# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Solved

Supervised machine learning consist of data analysis and data modelling work on different dataset. Every directory contains the different method that was used for building a model. Infact it can be said that the different parts of Supervised Learning approach is covered in this repository.

Multiple works will be uploaded after the preparation of the notebook.

List of Supervised Learning Activity:

1. Vehicle Performance Prediction
  + contains EDA + Model Development + Stochastic Gradient Descent


More work will be added soon and the information will be updated on addition of each new work.
